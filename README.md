# codewars
This is a collection of my codewars solutions which are divided by their levels (kyus). <br>
Each .js file represented one challenge (kata) solved. 
<br>
<br>
## How It's Made:
All challenges are solved with JavaScript. I push a minimum of 7 solutions every week. 
<br>
<br>
## Optimizations
As I continue to learn, I plan on revisiting my completed solutions to refactor and optimize my code to improve its readability and efficiency.
<br>
I'm excited to see my progress!
